## Biometric Cattle identification System 
It is an advanced biometric cattle identification system utilizing OpenCV for feature extraction, and processing over
10,000 images and selecting six critical features from cattle images, achieving a feature extraction accuracy of 95%.

Starting from scratch , if a cattle is not present in database , it adds its unique ID into it , and if already present , just a messege is shown with "cattle already present in database"
